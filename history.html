            <p>Minion is situated firmly within the tradition of old-style text typefaces, used for books since not long after the invention of printing with movable type. Minion draws on the form and style of the book types of the Renaissance, but it also draws on the robust 20th-­century revival of classic typefaces, from the early revivals in foundry type by Deberny & Peignot and American Type Founders to the later, highly successful revivals for machine setting by the Monotype and Linotype companies.</p>

            <p id="anchor8">Minion grew out of the confluence of Robert Slimbach’s practice of calligraphy with a broad-edged pen and his researches into the history of Renaissance type design and production while he was creating Adobe Garamond. He had been studying not only Garamond’s historical types but Jenson’s, and the Aldine types cut by Griffo. The Aldine types in particular seemed to him directly related to letters written with the broad-edged pen. They represent a refinement of the earlier Venetian models, yet still retain the immediacy and principled forms of the original manuscript hands.</p>

              <p>This kinship may be most obvious in the italics, which were based more or less directly on the common writing style of the Italian scholars of the late 15th century, but it’s true as well of the roman types, with their roots in more formal Humanist writing styles. Slimbach found all of these types to be a revelation: “beautiful and practical in perfect balance,” he says. His own calligraphic practice made him acutely aware of the handwritten ante­cedents of the early Renaissance types, and he began his studies for what would become Minion by writing out the letters before ever converting them into digital outlines.</p>

            <div class="Etexttwo" id="anchor11">
              <p>In its construction, Minion roman as originally conceived was “sympathetic to the digital limitations of the time,” as Slimbach puts it. It has flat serifs, and its stems are straight, without any flare; the curves, he says, “handle most of the face’s calligraphic feel.” This made sense given the lower resolution of both screens and much printed output in 1990; the straight stems also made the face look “contemporary” despite its historical inspiration. It’s a fine balance of the digital and the hand-made, well suited to long texts in the modern world.</p>

          <div class="bottomparagraph" id="anchor12">
            <p>The result was that 20th-century book designers found, in contemporary type-specimens, a wide palette of type designs to choose from, and many of the best designers studied the typography and printing of past centuries in order to understand their context and how to use them effectively. The text typefaces offered by Monotype, Linotype, Bert­hold, and other major vendors set a high standard of machine-set book typesetting. Many of those typefaces had their roots in the Renaissance.</p>
